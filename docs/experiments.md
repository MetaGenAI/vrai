# Initial experiments

At the beginning of the project, most of us had little experience (at least hands-on experience) with reinforcement learning (RL), so we played around with ML-Agents and custom RL code on simple tasks to get experience, even before the software framework to connect to VR was ready.

## Curiosity-driven learning

## Hide and Seek

A simple multi-agent RL task, using ML-Agent

## Imitation learning vs RL

... We decided to focus on IL

# VR experiments

After the [software framework](software) for connecting ML-Agents and NeosVR was ready, we began doing some simple experiments
